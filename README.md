# My Configurations Scripts!

This is my collection of scripts that perform various tasks. This repo is mainly to hold scripts that allow me to use my computer in the most natural way that possible.

## Contents of this Repo

### i3 folder

This folder holds scripts that I wish to run at the Desktop environment level. i3 is a great place to run scripts because it is simple to bind keys to perform tasks that can be done in a shell

#### Scripts

1. wallpaper.py
     - This script goes through my `~/Pictures/` directory to choose a random picture as my wallpaper
